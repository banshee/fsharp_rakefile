To use this rakefile:

* Put it in the root directory of your MonoTouch project.
* In MonoDevelop, bring up the project options for your project (right-click on the project file, choose 'options')
* Choose General > Custom Commands
* Add a 'before build' step
* Figure out the right values for FSHARP_PROJECT, FSHARP_EXE, FSHARP_DLL, and MONO
* In the 'command' field, enter the rake command:

rake default FSHARP_PROJECT=/Users/jamesmoore/dev/deleteme1/Library1/Library1/MonoTouchTest.fsproj FSHARP_COMPILER_EXE=/Users/jamesmoore/dev/FSharp-1.9.6.16/bin/fsc.exe FSHARP_DLL=fsharp.dll 

This sample is for a VS project in /Users/jamesmoore/dev/deleteme1/Library1 and a compiler in
/Users/jamesmoore/dev/FSharp-1.9.6.16/bin/fsc.exe - you'll need to change it to reflect your own locations.
